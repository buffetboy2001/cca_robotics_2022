# CCA Robotics 2022

Course materials for [Cornerstone Classical Academy](https://www.ccaroanoke.org) (Roanoke, VA, USA) high-school robotics class, academic year 2022-23.

Course Instructor: Stuart Bowman (e.g. [buffetboy2001 on GitHub](https://github.com/buffetboy2001), [faculty listing](https://cornerstoneclassicalroanoke.org/stuart-bowman))

**NOTE**: This guide will be changing continuously until the end of the 22/23 academic year.

## Course Goals

A basic instruction to the interdisciplinary world of robotics will be covered. Students are not expected to have any technical background at all, but will learn little-by-little along the way using hands-on projects.

## Project Summary

We'll use the [Lego Mindstorms Robot Inventor](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/robot-inventor-51515) kit to dive into robotics! The kit comes with instructions for 5 different robots. 

My goal for this year is to keep the students engaged by using lego builds that give them a working robot quickly. They will get some time to explore that robot, then off to the next build. I want them to build a few of the robots in order to get familiar with:

* lego technics mechanical concepts;
* the [mindstorms app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/lego%C2%AE-mindstorms%C2%AE-robot-inventor/9MTQ0N7W1D6X?hl=en-us&gl=us) with scratch programming language;
* the kinds of behaviors that these robots can accomplish.

Once the group familiarity has increased sufficiently, I want to use the second semester as a challenge time. The students will be given a collaborative task that two robots must perform together. They will work as a team to decide which two robots to bring to the challenge. Here's how I think this year will go:

* Three robots can be built before Christmas break;
* January they will continue to build using lego instructions;
* January, I will present the challenge;
* Feb-March will be design time for the students;
* April will be robot testing;
* May 4 & 11 will be the final challenge day.
